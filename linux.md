# Linux commands

Here's some commands i've tried on my virtual machine(VM Ware):

- pwd: print working directory.
- ls -a: This will list all files and directories in the current directory, including hidden files.
- less 'file name': It displays the contents of a file one screenful at a time and allows you to scroll through the file.
- touch 'myfile': This command creates a new file in the current directory or updates the modification time of an existing file.
- cp file.txt newfile.txt: This command stands for "copy." When executed, it copies one or more files from one location to another.
- mv example.txt exam.txt: This command stands for "move." When executed, it moves one or more files from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files.
- grep: This command searches for a specific pattern within a file or files. It can be used to search for specific text or to filter results.
- ping: This command is used to test the connectivity between your computer and another computer or server on the network.
   ping c 5 google.com -> This would send 5 packets to the google.com host
- ps: command without any options, it will display a list of running processes for the current terminal session
- chown: This command stands for "change owner." It allows you to change the ownership of files and directories to a different user or group.
- htop: This command is a program that displays a real time view of the processes running on the system, including CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
